## Detailed Analysis

### 1. REPL - Replimune Group Inc. 🟢 STRONG BUY

**Drug**: RP1 + nivolumab (oncolytic immunotherapy for advanced melanoma)
**PDUFA Date**: April 10, 2026 (Priority BLA, Class II Resubmission)
**Current Price**: $9.14 | **Entry Window**: Feb 9, 2026 | **Exit Window**: Apr 3, 2026

#### Why This Works
- **Perfect Timing**: Entry date is 37 days away - ideal positioning for accumulation
- **Strong Catalyst**: FDA accepted BLA resubmission (Oct 2025) after addressing CRL issues
- **Momentum**: Stock up 86.51% in past month on BLA acceptance news
- **Financial Strength**: $536.5M cash, 20-month runway - zero dilution risk
- **Technical**: Price consolidating after spike, good entry setup

#### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Runway**: Q4 2026 (ample time through PDUFA)
- **Binary Risk**: Mitigated by exiting 7 days before decision

**Action**: Accumulate between $8.50-$9.50 starting Feb 9. Target exit Apr 3.

### 2. AXSM - Axsome Therapeutics Inc. 🟢 BUY

**Drug**: AXS-05 (Alzheimer's disease agitation)
**PDUFA Date**: April 30, 2026 (Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy Designation)
**Current Price**: $152.05 | **Entry Window**: Feb 29, 2026 | **Exit Window**: Apr 23, 2026

#### Why This Works
- **De-risked Play**: AXS-05 already approved as Auvelity for MDD ($500M+ annualized sales)
- **Huge Market**: AD agitation is $3B peak sales opportunity (Truist estimate)
- **Priority Review**: 6-month review cycle indicates FDA urgency
- **Near Profitability**: Revenue growing 63% YoY, approaching cash flow positive
- **Strong Balance Sheet**: $325M cash, no financing needs

#### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Runway**: Approaching profitability (infinite runway)
- **Approval Probability**: Higher than typical due to existing MDD approval and Breakthrough designation

**Action**: Accumulate on dips starting late Feb. Exit Apr 23 regardless of sentiment.

### 3. RYTM - Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc. 🟡 HOLD/BUY

**Drug**: Imcivree (acquired hypothalamic obesity sNDA)
**PDUFA Date**: March 20, 2026 (Priority Review, extended from Dec 2025)
**Current Price**: $112.14 | **Entry Window**: Jan 19, 2026 | **Exit Window**: Mar 13, 2026

#### Why This Works
- **Imminent Entry**: Entry window opens in 16 days (Jan 19)
- **Revenue-Stage Asset**: IMCIVREE already approved for age 12+ rare obesity disorders
- **Strong Financials**: $416M cash, 24-month runway, $51M Q3 revenue (+54% YoY)
- **Orphan Status**: Rare disease designation reduces competitive risk
- **Analyst Support**: Strong Buy consensus, $127 avg PT vs $112 current

#### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Runway**: 24 months (exceptional)
- **Timing Risk**: Entry window approaching fast - monitor closely

**Action**: Watch for entry setup Jan 15-19. If entering, plan exit by Mar 13 (7 days before PDUFA).

### 4. ALDX - Aldeyra Therapeutics Inc. 🔴 SPECULATIVE BUY

**Drug**: Reproxalap (dry eye disease)
**PDUFA Date**: March 16, 2026 (Standard NDA, 3rd submission)
**Current Price**: $4.72 | **Entry Window**: Jan 15, 2026 | **Exit Window**: Mar 9, 2026

#### Why This Works
- **Deep Value**: Trading near 52-week low ($1.14-$7.20 range)
- **Positive Signal**: FDA provided draft label in Dec 2025 (suggests approval leaning)
- **Analyst Upside**: $7-13 price targets vs $4.72 current (48-176% upside)
- **Entry Timing**: Entry window opens in 12 days (Jan 15)

#### Why This Is Risky
- **2 Prior CRLs**: FDA rejected twice (2023, 2024) on efficacy concerns
- **Limited Runway**: 12 months cash (~$75M) - may need financing mid-2026
- **Market Skepticism**: Stock priced for failure despite draft label
- **Small Cap**: $283M market cap = high volatility

#### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Runway**: 12 months (adequate through PDUFA, tight after)
- **Binary Risk**: Highest of all 4 picks - true binary bet

**Action**: ONLY for risk-tolerant traders. Small position size. Enter Jan 15-20, strict exit Mar 9.

## Key Assumptions & Disclaimers

### Strategy Logic
- **Historical Pattern**: Biotech stocks often see 20-40% run-up in the 60 days before major FDA decisions as speculation increases
- **Exit Rationale**: Binary events (approval/rejection) are coin flips - exit during hype phase, not speculation aftermath
- **Risk Control**: Cash runway <6 months = automatic exclusion (dilution destroys run-up gains)

### Verification Standards
- All PDUFA dates verified via official company IR press releases
- Third-party calendar sites (BioPharmCatalyst, CatalystAlert) used for discovery only, NOT confirmation
- Cash positions sourced from Q3 2025 10-Q filings or earnings releases

### Limitations
- This is NOT investment advice - for informational purposes only
- PDUFA dates can be extended by FDA (monitor company updates)
- Market conditions, competitor news, or macro events can override technical patterns
- Past run-up patterns do not guarantee future performance
