"Buy the rumor (anticipation), Sell the news (before release)."

## Timeline Parameters

2. **Accumulation Zone (Buy)**: Event - 60 Days to - 45 Days
   - Why? Institutional money starts positioning ~2 months prior.
3. **Distribution Zone (Sell)**: Event - 7 Days to - 3 Days
   - Why? Avoid binary event risk (Approval vs CRL).

## Failure Conditions (Do Not Buy)

- Phase 2 data was mixed/weak.
- Stock is already trading at 52-week highs (Priced in).
